I got tired of managing Azure blob storage and switched over to using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for my [Photo Gallery](/gallery). This has resulted in an insane performance boost to the page, so much so that I've unlimited it and now 500+ images will load, lazily, as you scroll down the page. 

This is a great improvement and just one of several changes I have been planning for this site for a while. Stay tuned!
